```

## Usage

```js
const unique = require('unique-words');

console.log(unique('one two one two three'));
// => ['one', 'two', 'three']

console.log(unique(['foo', 'foo', 'foo bar', 'bar', 'bar baz foo']));
// => ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
```

## .counts

A `.counts()` method is exposed for getting the number of occurrences of each word.

```js
console.log(unique.counts('one two one two three'));

```

## Case sensitivity
